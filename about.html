      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        I sometimes struggle with self-doubt about the future of frontend development, especially as AI continues to
        advance rapidly. At times, I question whether there will still be meaningful work and opportunities for
        developers like me, even though I remain eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.
